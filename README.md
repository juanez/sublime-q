# sublime-q

Based it on https://github.com/kimtang/sublime-q but quite heavily reworked.

This properly identifies functions and variable assignments.
Will not properly identify projections, or function calls omitting [].
Enables goto definition, symbol lookup.


q_out_view.py should be used with https://github.com/komsit37/sublime-q where it will send q responses to a 'view' rather than an output panel.
